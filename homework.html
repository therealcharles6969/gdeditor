<div id="console">I was walking home from school, lost in thought, when I saw the black cat. It sat in the middle of the sidewalk, staring at me with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. At first, I thought I was just tired, maybe imagining things after a long day, but something about the cat felt... wrong.

It stood up on its hind legs, staring right at me. And then it spoke. The words weren’t anything I’d ever heard before—strange, otherworldly sounds that made my head ache. I took a step back, but before I could react further, the distant sound of helicopters filled the air.

I looked up. Police helicopters were circling above, their spotlights zeroing in on the cat. Within moments, squad cars screeched to a halt around us, and officers poured out, guns drawn. The whole street was lit up in flashing lights, and I was stuck in the middle of it all, frozen.

The cat didn’t seem bothered by any of it. It just stood there, unflinching, as the officers shouted warnings. Then, without a hint of hesitation, it changed. Its body twisted and warped, splitting open like something out of a nightmare. Razor-sharp teeth formed where its face had been, and it lunged at the closest officer. In one horrifying motion, it swallowed him whole.

The other officers stood paralyzed with shock. I couldn’t move, couldn’t think. My mind raced as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.

And then—like something out of a horror movie—the cat began to shift again. Its body reformed into the exact image of the policeman it had just devoured. Same uniform, same face... but its eyes, those glowing, otherworldly eyes, gave it away. The police didn’t know whether to fire or run.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, the alert tone bringing me back to reality. I fumbled to pull it out, my hands trembling. On the screen was a breaking news notification:

“Alien spacecraft discovered this morning in the heart of the city. Authorities investigating possible extraterrestrial presence.”

My stomach dropped. This wasn’t just some bizarre coincidence. The thing standing in front of me—the creature that had just eaten a man and stolen his form—was connected to whatever had been found in the city today.

I looked back at the creature, now posing as a policeman, standing unnervingly still while the other officers watched in disbelief. They hadn’t seen the news yet. They didn’t know what I knew.

Panic surged through me. I had to get out of there, but my legs felt like lead. What if it came after me next? The creature’s glowing eyes flicked in my direction, and for a brief moment, I thought it knew I had seen the news, that I had figured out what it was.

I turned to run, but the street was blocked by police vehicles and panicked officers. The air was filled with the thumping of the helicopter blades overhead and the chaos of police radios crackling. No one knew what to do—no one except the alien. It was already planning its next move, watching the confusion spread.

And now I knew: this wasn’t over. Whatever had come down from the sky this morning, it wasn’t alone. And this cat—this thing—was just the beginning.
